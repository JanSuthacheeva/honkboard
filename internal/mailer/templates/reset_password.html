{{define "subject"}}Honkboard - Your Password Reset Code{{end}}
{{define "plainBody"}}
Hey, 

We heard a little honk — someone (hopefully you) requested to reset the password for your Honkboard account.

To reset your password, just copy the code below and paste it where prompted:

	{{.Code}}

If you didn’t request this, you can safely ignore this email — your password is still as safe as a goose guarding its nest.

The code will expire in 5 minutes, so don’t waddle too slowly!
